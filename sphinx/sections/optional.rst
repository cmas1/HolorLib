Optional components
=====================

The library also contains some optional modules that can be built after the installation:

* examples: these are some examples that demonstrate few uses of the library, such as how to construct and slice Holors.
* tests: these are some tests that check the behavior of the library.
* benchmarks: there are some benchmarks to evalaute the performance of the Holor containers.
* documentation: this same documentation can be built locally to be accessed offline.
