Pagmo/pygmo is a software developed and offered to the users in a full FLOSS philosophy. We have 
created it, mostly, in our spare time and as a tool to explore some research ideas we started
nourishing since our early investigations into the evolutionary computations / optimization field.

We use pagmo in the context of our work for the European Space Agency to evolve interplanetary spacecraft
trajectories as well as designs for spacecraft parts and more, but its capabilities go well beyond these
applications.
